Hello fellow sentient stardust time traveler! 

On my thesis journey at IDM, I have spent the months (since September) ideating on a thesis idea. I had a vague idea that I wanted to continue my journey into Queer studies, and I flirted with the possibility of doing something with noise and/or games. But, ultimately, I chose to do an art project on Queerness, memory, and Cubanidad/Latinidad.

I was inspired by a few pieces and artists. Namely, all the things José Esteban Muñoz has ever said, Félix González-Torres's piece [Untitled (Perfect Lovers)](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81074), and a piece I saw in the Fábrica de Arte Cubano called [De ritos y otras historias](https://www.museodelasmujeres.co.cr/exposiciones/de-ritos-y-otras-historias-por-yanahara-mauri-villarreal) by Yanahara Mauri Villarreal.

And through all this brain thinking, I've come to a project brief - behold! [The project brief PDF version is available by clicking here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lTJ5hUk10hQKZykFc1IVk2iGwUaoBQMT/view?usp=sharing)

***Memorias of Queer Cubanidad***

**Research Statement**
To explore the ties between memory, healing, community, queerness[^1], and Cubanidad.

**Where and Who**
As we see in Maia Kotrosits’  “Queer Persistence: On Death, History, and Longing for Endings,” the Queer community exists in a Queer time, both collectively healing from the past and existing in the present. José Esteban Muñoz’s “Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity” speaks to the Queer possibilities of time, speaking to the futurity of Queerness. One of his other works, “The Sense of Brown,” examines Queerness, brownness, Latinidad, and community. My thesis is a response to Queer temporality, using practice-based research to create a space for queer latinos to be and to heal.

**What**
My project will be an interactive installation. I will create a living room filled with Cuban decor and various mementos, with a queer spin. It will incorporate one video piece, along with original compositions.

**How**
My project will use various creative practices: music composition, video and audio editing, 3D printing and laser cutting. I will first sketch the main components of the installation, and prototype the individual pieces. Next, I will compose the sounds in the space and finalize the construction of the objects.

**Why**
As a queer Cuban, I have spent much of my life divorcing my Queer lineage from my Cuban identity because of generational trauma. I am not alone in this, as other queer people of color in my community have lived the same experience. This work is for me to proudly reclaim my Queer Cubanidad. Because the community exists and thrives collectively, this project is especially for my queer family to gather and find a space for healing the past together.
