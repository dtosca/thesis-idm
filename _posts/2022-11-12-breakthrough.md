Hello fellow rock floaters!

After consulting with various sources and brainstorming ideas, I still wasn’t quite sure of my thesis. Something was missing. I had a great conversation with my wife that led to a breakthrough. And, of course, I wrote a mid-day-inspiration-breakthrough email to my undergraduate advisor, shown below:

“I had a conceptual breakthrough in my thesis yesterday that I wanted to share bc if i don't put it into words it'll melt into the ether.

I had some deliverables due for my thesis class, and I was dreading coming up with how to "queer" objects. Naturally, I talked to Hazel - ee both had a Last Supper painting above our dining tables growing up (as many Latine families did). and as I was spitballing ideas on how to distort the Last Supper, she said something that recontextualized the whole project for me - "i already see The Last Supper as Queer."

I don't need to have these objects from my childhood change to be queer necessarily - it's the context that they're in that makes them queer. Hazel's reasons for having a Last Supper painting over a dining room are very different from her family's reason for example.

So the next challenge - how do I help people understand the new context The Last Supper is in? My immediate thought - have headphones next to the painting where people can listen in on Hazel and I having a conversation discussing the painting. And what if all the objects in the room had this same thing - a conversation discussing the objects? It's like a ghostly presence in the room - a disembodied voice carrying the memory of the objects. That inherently Queers/distorts time - the past/present/future become one. Hazel and I create a lineage - as though we are parents talking to our children about the things in our living room.

I have tons more examples for objects (a game corner, a medicine drawer)  - but it feels like I just found a huge part of the puzzle and the actual central theme of this - memory and the togetherness/queer lineage that comes with that memory.“
