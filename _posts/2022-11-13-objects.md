I got some feedback on my project brief that really rattled me for a while, ”...if this project is a personal experience/response or a collective experience/response within the community you want to represent.” During a portfolio review, I received similar feedback from an art professor about a piece honoring my late grandmother and reflecting on trauma. He said, “I wonder if anyone can relate to this?”

This criticism strikes a nerve with me, and I think created a false dichotomy  - why can’t personal experience be part of a collective experience, or encompass some universality to it? As far as I see it, for this project the personal experience *is* part of the collective identity of queerness. Some of the most striking art I’ve ever experienced was deeply personal to the artists - and it still impacted me. The art we make doesn’t have to be diluted and generalized for people to understand it or for it to have value.

In that vein, I decided to make the objects I’m showcasing as deeply personal as possible.
I’ve divided them into four general themes, and made some sketches accompany the work.

- Queerness and Catholicism
    - The Last Supper Painting
    - Santa Barbara statue
    - San Lazaro statue
    - Rosary

- Game corner (with game rules for solo players)
	- Dominoes
    - Parchís (Ludo)
    - Tarot deck
    - My Queer gaming manifesto

- Medicines / “healing”
    - Vicks vaporub
    - Picot (Sal de uva)
    - Manzanilla recipe
    - Frog statue
    - Chair
    - Metformin bottles

- Media
    - Videos of people inhabiting the space before
    - 2 clocks
    - MP3 player with song covers/remixed made by me
